## Other Notes

I really enjoyed and learned a lot over the course of this project. Bootstrap, although a little generic, is really clean looking out of the box and not as difficult to mold/customize as it's made out to be. React Router was very easy to get up and running. I look forward to working with some of it's more complex capabilities in upcoming projects. Vite was super fast and deploying with Vercel was almost suspiciously easy. I don't think I'll ever use CRA or GH Pages ever again.
